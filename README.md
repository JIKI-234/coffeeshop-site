☕ Sydeonarya's Coffee — Personal Website (Rebuilt)

This is a custom portfolio website I built, a fictional and a conceptual coffee shop. 
This version is a complete rebuild of the original concept I created earlier in my learning journey. 
It reflects how much I’ve grown in layout structure, responsiveness, and design polish.

🧠 About the Rebuild

I originally made this site while I was still learning the basics of web development. 
Although functional, the first version had layout and responsiveness issues. 
After improving up my skills, I decided to rebuild it from scratch to improve the design, structure, and user experience.
